# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Accepted 100 Days of Code challenge.

**Thoughts:** I just accepted the #100DaysOfCoding challenge. In the first few days of this journey, I am planning to build a simple wordpress website to showcase my other coding projects

I have been working as a data engineer for several years now. However, I was never a front-end developer even though I always admired the art and craft behind many cool websites out there. So, I am going to take this opportunity to finally get my hands dirty and build a website for myself. It will act as a landing page from where visitor can navigate to blog posts, social media accounts and coding projects.
