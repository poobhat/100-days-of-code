# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Accepted 100 Days of Code challenge.

**Thoughts:** I just accepted the #100DaysOfCoding challenge. In the first few days of this journey, I am planning to build a simple wordpress website to showcase my other coding projects

I have been working as a data engineer for several years now. However, I was never a front-end developer even though I always admired the art and craft behind many cool websites out there. So, I am going to take this opportunity to finally get my hands dirty and build a website for myself. It will act as a landing page from where visitor can navigate to blog posts, social media accounts and coding projects.

### Day 1: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a static home page for my new website. Hosted it on Dream Host. Customised few modules. Still working on finalizing the design and layout for the content, which is yet to be published.

**Thoughts:** I had difficult time with a poor internet connectivity from the place I was working. Expecting to be more productive once I get this fixed tomorrow
